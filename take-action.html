    <p>
      With your fundraising and monetary donations, UNICEF, along with Kiwanis
      International will provide vaccinations and other life-saving measures for
      women in developing countries. This partnership is known as the Eliminate
      Project. So far, nearly 100 million women have already been vaccinated
      against the disease, but some countries still have yet to eliminate MNT.

        Help the kids who need more than candy and join the fight for the
        survival of children from MNT. UNICEF gives free fundraising kits with
        collection boxes each year, but gear up for Halloween 2020 with
        <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/trick-or-treat">UNICEF Updates</a>
        on how to set up a successful fundraising campaign! All funds raised for
        UNICEF will be used to provide mothers and babies tetanus immunity
        vaccines, safe materials for childbirth, and resources for sustenance.
        Don’t forget -- students, parents, businesses, teachers, and so many
        more people can donate!

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
        When UNICEF has enough funds to provide supplies, medical staff,
        immunity vaccines, and education, no mother and child will ever have to
        be worried about the life-threatening disease. Impoverished future
        mothers and babies will be immune from MNT and have access to resources
        and help despite their barriers. You can make it happen.
