         Areas impacted by humanitarian crises but 
          have no access to medical aid or resources 
          should not be a problem -- yet, it is. This powerful <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/mission/survival/immunization/tetanus/eliminate">video</a>
          showcases what mothers face 
          and UNICEF’s fight against MNT.

UNICEF's Journey: The Fight
      </h2>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        A UNICEF staff explains: “When these mothers give birth at home, 
        they more than likely give birth on the ground -- lying on leaves, 
        where there’s tetanus spores…[some of the materials] that are used 
        are not safe and hygienic. They use bamboo, razor blades that are 
        not sterilized, or scissors that are not sterilized.” This moving video 
        educates viewers on what Kiwanis & UNICEF are doing and why your 
        help is so necessary. It documents UNICEF's trip 
        to underserved areas as well as footages of babies with MNT.

<ul>
  <li>Tetanus spores are found everywhere in the soil 
    and ground, where mothers give birth. When they come 
    in contact to cuts from childbirth, mothers and babies 
    contract the disease. </li>
  <li>The bamboo stick in the picture is a tool used in 
    the birthing process, which is not clean or safe. </li>
  <li>The are high mortality rates in developing 
    countries where there is no medical aid, poverty is 
    prevalent, and locations are  remote. </li>
  <li> Fortunately, the disease can be easily prevented with a an 
    inexpensive vaccine as well as safe childbirth practices. </li>

        The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2018 (the latest available estimate), 25,000 newborns died from NT. </p>
      
      <p>
        It is an 88% reduction from the situation in 2000, with a figure of 200,000.</p>
      <p> 
  
MNT-related deaths are "indicators of inequity in access to immunization and other maternal, newborn, and child health services...as is often the case in low income countries.
Fortunately, "MNT deaths can be easily prevented by hygienic delivery and cord care practices, and/or by immunizing children and women with Tetanus Toxoid Containing Vaccines (TTCV), that are inexpensive and very efficacious." 
      </p>
        <p> As of June 2020, there are only 12 COUNTRIES left to eliminate. Your donations are certainly impactful. Everyone can be a hero!

#Eliminate

      <p>
       Poverty perpetuates cycles of death. 
        Tetanus spores will always exist. Childbirth causes 
        open cuts and mothers and babies to get MNT. They have 
        no help, no vaccines, and unsanitary materials. No one 
        will ever be safe from MNT. YOU can end this!

How You Can Help
      </h2>

     With your fundraising and  monetary donations, UNICEF, 
       along with Kiwanis International will provide vaccinations 
       and other life-saving measures for women in developing countries. 
       This partnership is known as the Eliminate Project. So far, 
       nearly 100 million women have already been vaccinated against 
       the disease, but some countries still have yet to eliminate MNT. 
       Learn how everyone can save our children of the world under the tab,
       “TAKE ACTION!”
